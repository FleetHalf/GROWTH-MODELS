Motivation

"All theory depends on assumptions which are not quite true. That is what makes it theory. The art of successful theorizing is to make the inevitable simplifying assumptions in such a way that the 
final results are not very sensitive.A "crucial" assumption is one on which the conclusions do depend sensitively, and it is important that crucial assumptions be reasonably realistic. When the 
results of a theory seem to flow specifically from a special crucial assumption, then if the assumption is dubious, the results are suspect."(Solow, 1956)

These are the words by Robert M. Solow in his paper published in 1956 which first introduced the Solow growth model. Here, the author is referring to the "Harrod-Domar" growth model, which
was primarily based on the "crucial" assumption of "Fixed Proportions'". The primary motivation of developing the Solow growth model was to develop a growth model similar to the Harrod-Domar 
growth model, but which did not assume "Fixed Proportions".

Solow does the by using a slightly different framework while accepting all the assumptions of Harrod-Domar except that of fixed proportions. He supposes that a single composite commodity (think 
of it as domestic output) is produced by two inputs- Labor and Capital- under the standard neoclassical conditions. 


Components of the Model

Here, we discuss the various components or variables that are used in the development of the Solow model. 

Output- This can be thought of as the collection of output produced by the nation. We give the **rate** of it's production by Y(t). Y(t) denotes the amount of output produced in a unit of 
time. This can also be thought of as the GDP. On the other hand production possibilities are represented by the function

Y = F(K,L)

Here we assume the production function to be of the Cobb-Douglas type. It is increasing, concave and exhibits constant returns to scale. This implies that the the Marginal Product of both Labor 
and Capital is decreasing- high level of production can be achieved only by increasing both inputs. 

Depreciation - We denote the rate of depreciation by delta. Another approach would be to subsume depreciation in the output itself (which is how Solow does in his 1956 paper), but he former is 
more lucid. The rate of depreciation is constant. 

Capital Stock - The Capital Stock, denoted by K(t), can be thought of as the accumulation of the composite commodity over time- the rate of which is given by kdot. kdot can be thought of as the 
rate of investment. Here, we make the assumption of full employment of capital stock. That is, at any point of time, the pre-existing stock of capital is inelastically supplied. (**)


Derivation of the SGM

- We assume that a constant part of the output produced is saved and subsequently invested. That is,

S = s*Y

We know that in neoclassical theory, planned savings is equal to planned investment.

Now, planned investment - given by Kdot - can be obtained by subtracting depreciation from savings

Kdot = s*F(K,L) - D...(1)

where depreciation occurs as a certain percentage of capital stock. That is D = delta*K

We assume the Labor grows exponential at the rate 'n':

L(t) = L0 * e^(nt) ...(2)

Substituting in (1), we get

Kdot = s*F(K,L0e^(nt)) - delta*K

Now, we define a new variable `r`, where r = K / L is the capital-labor ratio- or the capital per labor. We try to express (3) in terms of one variable- `r`

r = K / L

K = r*L

K = r*(2)

Differentitating K with respect to `t`, we get


Kdot = rn*L0*e^(nt) + rdot*L0e^(nt)

Kdot = L0*e^(nt)* [rn + rdot]

From (1) 

s*F(K,L) - delta*K = (L0 * e^(nt)) * (rn + rdot) 

Now, we divide both sides by L. Since, F is a homogenous function of first degree, we get


s*F( r , 1 ) - delta*K = ( rn + rdot)

rdot = s*F( r , 1 ) - r(n + delta) ...(5)


Equation is (5) is our final equation. This equation is the equilibrium condition. Upon a closer look, on the RHS, the ` F( r , 1 )` component is the output per labor, and  ` s*F( r , 1 ) ` is the `savings
per labor`. The second term `rn` is the `rate of growth of investment`. Equation (5) basically states that the "growth rate in savings must be equal to the growth rate of investment in order to 
achieve equilibrium.
