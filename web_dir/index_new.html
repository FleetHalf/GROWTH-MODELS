    theory depends on assumptions which are not quite true. That is what makes it theory. The art of successful theorizing is to make the inevitable 
    simplifying assumptions in such a way that the final results are not very sensitive. A "crucial" assumption is one on which the conclusions do 
    depend sensitively, and it is important that crucial assumptions be reasonably realistic. When the results of a theory seem to flow specifically
    from a special crucial assumption, then if the assumption is dubious, the results are suspect."

    These are the words by Robert M. Solow in his paper published in 1956 which first introduced the Solow growth model. Here, the author is referring to the "Harrod-Domar" growth model, which
    was primarily based on the "crucial" assumption of "Fixed Proportions'". The primary motivation of developing the Solow growth model was to develop a growth model similar to the Harrod-Domar 
    growth model, but which did not assume "Fixed Proportions".
</p>  

<p style = 'padding-bottom: 50px;'>
    Solow does the by using a slightly different framework while accepting all the assumptions of Harrod-Domar except that of fixed proportions. He supposes that a single composite commodity (think 
    of it as domestic output) is produced by two inputs- Labor and Capital- under the standard neoclassical conditions.

<br>
<br>

<p style = 'margin-left: 30px'>
    Here, we discuss the various components or variables that are used in the development of the Solow model.
 </p>

<ol class = 'basic_list'>

    <li>
        <p>
            <b style = 'text-decoration: underline; font-size: 24px;'>Output</b>- This can be thought of as the collection of output produced by the nation. We give the <b><i>rate</i></b> of it's production by <b style = 'font-family: segoe UI'>Y( t )</b> - which denotes the amount of output produced in a unit of 
    time. This can also be thought of as the GDP. On the other hand production possibilities are represented by the function<br><br>
    
    <div style = 'text-align: center; font-family:  segoe UI; ;'>Y = F( K , L )</div>
    
    <br><br>
    Here, we assume the production function to be of the Cobb-Douglas type. It is increasing, concave and exhibits constant returns to scale. This implies that the the Marginal Product of both Labor 
    and Capital is decreasing- high level of production can be achieved only by increasing both inputs. 
    </li>
    </p>

<br>
<li>
    <p>
        <b style = 'text-decoration: underline; font-size: 24px;'>Depreciation</b> - We denote the rate of depreciation by delta. Another approach would be to subsume depreciation in the output itself (which is how Solow does in his 1956 paper), but he former is 
    more lucid. The rate of depreciation is constant.
</p>
</li>
<br>
<li>
    <p>
        <b style = 'text-decoration: underline; font-size: 24px;'>Capital Stock</b> - The Capital Stock, denoted by K(t), can be thought of as the accumulation of the composite commodity over time- the rate of which is given by kdot. kdot can be thought of as the 
rate of investment. Here, we make the assumption of full employment of capital stock. That is, at any point of time, the pre-existing stock of capital is inelastically supplied.
