            theory depends on assumptions which are not quite true. That is what makes it theory. The art of successful
            theorizing is to make the inevitable
            simplifying assumptions in such a way that the final results are not very sensitive. A "crucial" assumption
            is one on which the conclusions do
            depend sensitively, and it is important that crucial assumptions be reasonably realistic. When the results
            of a theory seem to flow specifically
            from a special crucial assumption, then if the assumption is dubious, the results are suspect."

        These are the words of Robert M. Solow from his paper published in 1956, which introduced the Solow growth
        model.
        In this context, Solow refers to the "Harrod-Domar" growth model, which was primarily founded on the "crucial"
        assumption of "Fixed Proportions". The main aim behind developing the Solow growth model was to create a growth
        model akin to the Harrod-Domar model
        but without assuming "Fixed Proportions"
    </p>

    <p style='padding-bottom: 50px;'>
        Solow achieves this by employing a slightly different framework while retaining all the assumptions of the
        Harrod-Domar model except for fixed proportions. He proposes that a single composite commodity (akin to domestic
        output) is produced by two inputs - <i>Labor</i> and <i>Capital</i> - under standard neoclassical conditions.

    <p style='margin-left: 30px'>
        Here, we discuss the various components or variables that are used in the development of the Solow model.

        <li>
            <p>
                <b style='text-decoration: underline; font-size: 24px;'>Output</b>- This can be thought of as the
                collection of output produced by the nation. We give the <b><i>rate</i></b> of it's production by <b
                    style='font-family: segoe UI'>Y( t )</b> - which denotes the amount of output produced in a unit of
                time. This can also be thought of as the GDP. On the other hand production possibilities are represented
                by the function<br><br>

            <div style='text-align: center; font-family:  segoe UI; ;'>Y = F( K , L )</div>

            <br><br>
            Here, we assume the production function to be of the Cobb-Douglas type. It is increasing, concave and
            exhibits constant returns to scale. This implies that the the Marginal Product of both Labor
            and Capital is decreasing- high level of production can be achieved only by increasing both inputs.

            <p>
                <b style='text-decoration: underline; font-size: 24px;'>Depreciation</b> - We denote the rate of
                depreciation by Î´ (delta). Another approach would be to subsume depreciation in the output itself (which
                is how Solow does in his 1956 paper), but he former is
                more lucid. The rate of depreciation is constant.

            <p>
                <b style='text-decoration: underline; font-size: 24px;'>Capital Stock</b> - The Capital Stock, denoted
                by K(t), can be thought of as the accumulation of the composite commodity over time- the rate of which
                is given by kdot. kdot can be thought of as the
                rate of investment. Here, we make the assumption of full employment of capital stock. That is, at any
                point of time, the pre-existing stock of capital is inelastically supplied.
